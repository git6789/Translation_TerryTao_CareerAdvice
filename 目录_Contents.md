这是我关于数学学术生涯建议的合集，粗略按与不同职业阶段的相关程度安排（当然，有的建议涉及多个阶段）。

*免责声明*：这里的建议本质上是很通用的，但我不会装作自己有能解决所有职业问题的"银子弹"。在做任何职业生涯的重要决定前，你肯定需要针对你自己的情况考虑很多因素，背景，当然还有一定的常识。我尤其建议你[和指导教师或顾问讨论](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/talk-to-your-advisor/)你的决定，如果有的话，毕竟他（她）熟悉你的情况。还有，请注意我的大多数建议是针对数学学术生涯的；当然此外还有其他很多职业生涯选择，但我对它们的特别深入的了解。

- 小学层面
  - [天赋儿童的教育](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/advice-on-gifted-education/)。
- 高中层面
  - [数学竞赛的建议](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/advice-on-mathematics-competitions/)。
  - [应该申请什么大学](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/which-universities-should-one-apply-to/)？
- 本科层面
  - 如何更擅长于[解决数学问题](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/solving-mathematical-problems/)？数学[不只是分数、测试和方法](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/theres-more-to-mathematics-than-grades-and-exams-and-methods/)；也不只是[严谨和证明](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/theres-more-to-mathematics-than-rigour-and-proofs/)。[重视局部进展，并以此为问题完整解决方案的垫脚石](https://plus.google.com/u/1/114134834346472219368/posts/Xdm8eiPLWZp)。
  - [别基于魅力和声望去做生涯决定](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/don%E2%80%99t-base-career-decisions-on-glamour-or-fame/)。以及你应该[尝试不同的地方](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/study-at-different-places/)。
  - [必须是天才才能在数学上成功吗](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/does-one-have-to-be-a-genius-to-do-maths/)？
- 毕业后层面
  - [努力](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/work-hard/)、[专业地工作](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/be-professional-in-your-work/)很重要。但[享受工作](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/enjoy-your-work/)也很重要。
  - [Think ahead](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/think-ahead/) to understand the way forward; [ask yourself dumb questions](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/ask-yourself-dumb-questions-%E2%80%93-and-answer-them/) to understand the way before.
  - [Attend talks and conferences, even those not directly related to your own work](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/attend-talks-and-conferences-even-those-not-directly-related-to-your-work/).
  - [Talk to your advisor](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/talk-to-your-advisor/), but also [take the initiative](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/take-the-initiative/).
  - Don’t [prematurely obsess on a single “big problem” or “big theory”](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/dont-prematurely-obsess-on-a-single-big-problem-or-big-theory/).
  - [Write down what you’ve done](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/write-down-what-youve-done/), and [make your work available](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/make-your-work-available/). In this regard, I have some advice on [how to write and submit papers](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/advice-on-writing-papers/).
- 博士后层面
  - [Learn and relearn your field](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/learn-and-relearn-your-field/), but[ don’t be afraid to learn things outside your field](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/don%E2%80%99t-be-afraid-to-learn-things-outside-your-field/).
  - [Learn the limitations of your tools](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/learn-the-limitations-of-your-tools/), but also [learn the power of other mathematician’s tools](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/learn-the-power-of-other-mathematicians-tools/). In particular, you should [continually aim just beyond your current range](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/continually-aim-just-beyond-your-current-range/).
  - In your research, be both [flexible](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/be-flexible/) and [patient](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/be-patient/).
  - You should definitely travel and present your research if given the opportunity. But be [considerate of your audience](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/be-considerate-of-your-audience/); talks are [not the same as papers](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/talks-are-not-the-same-as-papers/).
  - Be [sceptical of your own work](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/be-sceptical-of-your-own-work/), and don’t be afraid to [use the wastebasket](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/use-the-wastebasket/).

我还在（慢慢地）收集我关于时间管理的想法，以一个研究型数学家的角度。

- Here are some [general thoughts](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2008/08/07/on-time-management/) on this topic.
- [Batch low-intensity tasks together](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/career-advice/batch-low-intensity-tasks-together/) to take advantage of economies of scale and to reduce distraction.
- [What are some useful, but little-known, features of the tools used by professional mathematicians?](https://terrytao.wordpress.com/2017/07/07/what-are-some-useful-but-little-known-features-of-the-tools-used-in-professional-mathematics/)
